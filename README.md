Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (called the subclass or derived class)
to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class (called the superclass or base class). 
Inheritance forms an "is-a" relationship between classes, where the subclass is a specialized version of the superclass.

When a subclass inherits from a superclass, it automatically gains access to all 
the public and protected members (attributes and methods) of the superclass.
This means that the subclass can reuse and extend the functionality defined in the
superclass without having to duplicate code, promoting code reusability and maintainability
